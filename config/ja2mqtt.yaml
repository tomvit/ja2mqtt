# ja2mqtt definition file for JA121-T BUS RS-485 protocol
# You normally do not need to edit this file unless you want to change the way how JA121 protocol is implemented.
# The file uses Jinja templates and data from the yaml configuration file that defines Jablotron topology

system:
  # name of the propery for the correlation id in request payloads
  # the id will be copied from requests and copied to responses
  # when the correlation_id field is not present in request payload, no correlation will be done
  correlation_id: 'corrid'

  # correlation timeout in seconds
  # when a mqtt request is received, then within this timeout the response must be collected
  # the request-response will then share the same correlation id
  correlation_timeout: 1.5

  # number of bits in prfstate (default: 128)
  prfstate_bits: 24

# Definition of MQTT topics for serial output.
# The topics defined in `serial2mqtt` will be created in MQTT broker according to events that occur in the serial output
